Console 0.0.1
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:

You must use the module cmd
Your class definition must be: class HBNBCommand(cmd.Cmd):
Your command interpreter should implement:
quit and EOF to exit the program
help (this action is provided by default by cmd but you should keep it updated and documented as you work through tasks)
a custom prompt: (hbnb)
an empty line + ENTER shouldn’t execute anything
Your code should not be executed when imported
Warning:

You should end your file with:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    HBNBCommand().cmdloop()
to make your program executable except when imported. Please don’t add anything around - the Checker won’t like it otherwise

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) help quit
Quit command to exit the program
